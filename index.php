                    <p>Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A/C, or air con) is the process of removing heat and
                        moisture from the interior of an occupied space to improve the comfort of occupants. Air
                        conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most
                        commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other
                        animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with
                        heat-producing electronic devices to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.
                        We take up all types of Air-conditioning & Refrigeration work on big & small basis. </p>

                    <p>Insulating ducts helps the air within stay at the desired temperature. It also prevents the ducts
                        from leaking air. Ducts which leak air can result in greater energy consumption and expensive
                        utility bills. Heat loss through the duct walls is an expected and inevitable drain on the
                        system. Effective thermal insulation of the ductwork reduces this heat loss and helps to
                        minimize energy usage. If you have AC, insulating ducts is not only for energy efficiency. Cool
                        air passing through warm areas of a building can cause condensation and dripping, which can lead
                        to mold growth and safety issues such as falls. Uninsulated AC ducts are also at risk of
                        becoming rusted or stained, due to condensation on the metal.</p>

                    <p>Metal fabrication is the creation of metal structures by cutting, bending and assembling
                        processes. It is a value-added process involving the creation of machines, parts, and structures
                        from various raw materials. Typically, a fabrication shop bids on a job, usually based on
                        engineering drawings and if awarded the contract, builds the product. Large fab shops employ a
                        multitude of value-added processes, including welding, cutting, forming and machining. Metal
                        fabrication usually starts with drawings with precise dimensions and specifications. As with
                        other manufacturing processes, both human labor and automation are commonly used.</p>

                    <p>Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering, physics, engineering
                        mathematics, and materials science principles to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain
                        mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines. The
                        mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics,
                        dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition
                        to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD),
                        computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product life cycle management to design and analyze
                        manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport
                        systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch
                        of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.</p>

                    <p>Electrical engineering is a technical discipline concerned with the study, design and application
                        of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It
                        emerged as an identified activity in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization
                        of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use.
                        Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of fields including, computer
                        engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal
                        processing, instrumentation, and electronics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other
                        engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering,
                        power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology,
                        electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics, and electrical materials science. See
                        glossary of electrical and electronics engineering.</p>
